Dear Councilmember Jurado,

I am writing to share a concern regarding the safety of children at Eagle Rock Recreation Center Park. With the LA Parks and Recreation soccer season beginning soon, I have noticed a sharp increase in dogs being allowed off-leash on the baseball fields.

This raises a serious safety issue. My brother-in-lawâ€™s sister was bitten in the face by a dog as a child and was permanently scarred. I worry that if off-leash rules continue to be ignored, a similar tragedy could occur here.

I respectfully urge the City to address this issue before a child is harmed. Would it be possible to meet with you to discuss possible solutions?

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
